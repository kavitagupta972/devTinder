why we have pushed package-lock.json ---> 

order of the routes matter
play with routes and routes extensions like /hello /hello/2 /xyz / jkdfjkdjfk
difference between put and patch
browser is not good way to test apis, backend
install postman app and create workspace>collection and make a test api call
write a code to handle get, post, patch, delete api calls and test on postman
